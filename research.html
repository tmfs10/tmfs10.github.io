	  While only recently developed, the ability to profile expression
	  data in single cells (scRNA-Seq) has already led to several
	  important studies and findings. However, this technology has also
	  raised several new computational challenges. These include
	  questions about the best methods for clustering scRNA-Seq data,
	  how to identify unique group of cells in such experiments, and how
	  to determine the state or function of specific cells based on
	  their expression profile. To address these issues we develop and
	  test a method based on neural networks (NN) for the analysis and
	  retrieval of single cell RNA-Seq data. We tested various NN
	  architectures, some of which incorporate prior biological
	  knowledge, and used these to obtain a reduced dimension
	  representation of the single cell expression data. We show that
	  the NN method improves upon prior methods in both, the ability to
	  correctly group cells in experiments not used in the training and
	  the ability to correctly infer cell type or state by querying a
	  database of tens of thousands of single cell profiles. Such
	  database queries (which can be performed using our web server)
	  will enable researchers to better characterize cells when
	  analyzing heterogeneous scRNA-Seq samples. Read more about it <a

	  A stimulant (like a virus) to a cell can interact with proteins in
	  the cell and cause a cascade of signaling pathways that
	  activate/repress the expression of genes downstream. The
	  differential expression of such genes can cause further signaling
	  cascades that cause the differential expression of another set of
	  genes. While the gene expression at different time points can be
	  observed, it is not possible to directly observe the signaling
	  pathways responsible for their differential expression. We
	  developed a tool, <a
	  href="http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/timepath">TimePath</a>, to learn the
  progression of such signaling pathways across time based on time
  series gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data. Read

	  We developed a tool, <a href="http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/mtsdrem">MT-SDREM</a>, to jointly learn signaling pathways and regulatory networks using time series gene expression data from multiple related conditions, TF-gene interaction data, and a protein-protein signaling network. Our tool built on an existing tool called SDREM which learnt the signaling pathways and regulatory network for just a single condition. For joint learning, we shared information the following information :- (1) we ensured that the condition-specific networks learnt were consistent – i.e. the edge directions were the same for all networks (2) If a TF was predicted to regulate more than one condition, it’s prior for regulating any condition was increased. Validation with respect to RNAi screen hits, GO analysis and manual examination of the predicted signaling proteins demonstrated the advantage of joint inference.

			The Dial-a-ride problem involves a set of passengers that have to be picked up and dropped off at various locations within certain time windows. We developed an algorithm for this problem that was able to obtain close to optimal solutions much more quickly than the state of the art algorithms while still being able to prove if the problem was infeasible – something that most other algorithms did not do.

			Redundant clause learning is a popular technique used by SAT solvers to speed up search for a solution or proof of infeasibility for a boolean formula. We developed an algorithm to effectively learn clauses for a class of problems called multi-valued satisfiability problems which are a generalization of boolean formulas. Experimental results showed that our algorithm was several times faster than the standard technique of simply converting the multi-valued formula into its boolean equivalent.

			Solution counting for integer programs with only binary variables is a #P-complete problem. The motivation for this project was that several good techniques for lower bounding the number of solutions for such problems had been developed but the only non-trivial upper bounding technique was extremely slow (in fact, in experiments with the benchmarks we were looking at, it always timed out). We developed an upper bounding technique based on dynamic programming that was able to obtain non-trivial upper bounds much faster for several problems.

We examined a programming language abstraction called Stabilizers which had been developed for Concurrent ML for automatically recovering from failures in program execution. We wrote a Javascript library for doing the equivalent for web applications (a use case would be if the network connection suddenly died).
